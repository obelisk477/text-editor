## Usage

To use JATE, simply navigate to [JATE Text Editor](https://jate-text-editor-7578-678911497df2.herokuapp.com/) while connected to the internet. After that, you may use the text editor and can make changes both on and offline that will persist through your browsers internal database and local storage.

To download as an application, simply click the "Install" button on the top left of the navbar, and then confirm download by clicking "Install" again. This will donload the application, and any changes you've already made to the editor will persist inside the downloaded application. Conversely, changes made to the text editor in the app should appear in the browser as well upon return, regardless of online / offline status
